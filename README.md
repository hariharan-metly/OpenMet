# OpenMet Initiative

OpenMet Initiative is a new attempt to consolidate the tutorials/macros for softwares used for analysis in metallurgy and material science. This repository is also available in Researchgate as [OpenMet Initiative](https://www.researchgate.net/project/OpenMet-Initiative). People can also upload their own codes in programming language of their interest. This content/material can used for both educational and commercial purposes but the risk of accuracy/correctness of code/content is up to the user.
