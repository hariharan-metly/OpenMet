# OpenMet Initiative

OpenMet Initiative is a new attempt to consolidate the tutorials/macros for softwares used for analysis in metallurgy and material science. People can also upload their own codes in programming language of their interest. This initiative is only for educational and commercial purposes but the risk of accuracy/correctness of code/content is up to the user.
